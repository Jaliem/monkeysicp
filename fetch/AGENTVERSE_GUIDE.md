# 🚀 Agentverse Integration Guide - REAL Agent Communication

## ⚡ Why Agentverse API is Better

### ❌ **Previous Approach Issues:**
- Complex uAgents local setup
- Version compatibility problems  
- Manual agent address management
- Network configuration headaches

### ✅ **Agentverse API Benefits:**
- **Official API** - Designed for this exact use case
- **Cloud-hosted agents** - No local setup required
- **Reliable messaging** - Professional-grade infrastructure  
- **Easy management** - Web dashboard for all agents
- **Scalable** - Handles production workloads

---

## 🎯 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. **Configure Agentverse**
```bash
cd fetch
python setup_agentverse.py
```

This will ask for:
- Your Agentverse API key (from dashboard)
- Agent addresses (from deployed agents)

### 2. **Start Agentverse Bridge**
```bash
python start_agentverse.py
```

### 3. **Test Real Communication**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `/chat` and try:
- "I slept 8 hours" → Routes to WellnessAgent
- "Book me a doctor" → Routes to DoctorAgent  
- "Do you have aspirin?" → Routes to PharmacyAgent

## 🤖 How It Works

### **Message Flow:**
```
React Chat Input
       ↓ HTTP POST /api/chat
Agentverse Bridge (localhost:8080)
       ↓ Intent Classification
       ↓ Agentverse API Call
Agentverse Platform (cloud)
       ↓ Route to Correct Agent
Your Deployed Agent (HealthAgent/DoctorAgent/etc)
       ↓ Process with AI
       ↓ Return Response
Agentverse Platform
       ↓ API Response
Agentverse Bridge
       ↓ HTTP Response
React Chat Display
```

### **Intent Classification:**
- **Wellness:** "sleep", "steps", "exercise", "water" → WellnessAgent
- **Doctor:** "appointment", "book", "specialist" → DoctorAgent  
- **Pharmacy:** "medicine", "drug", "prescription" → PharmacyAgent
- **General:** Everything else → HealthAgent

## 📋 Setup Details

### **1. Get Your Agentverse API Key**

1. Go to https://agentverse.ai/dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**  
3. Create new API key with permissions:
   - ✅ Write access to All resources
   - ✅ Write access to Hosted Agents
   - ✅ Write access to Mailbox Features  
   - ✅ Write access to AI Services
   - ✅ Write access to Chat Resources

### **2. Deploy Your Agents**

Option A: **Use Agentverse Cloud Deployment**
- Upload your agent code to Agentverse
- Deploy directly on their platform
- Get agent addresses from dashboard

Option B: **Register Local Agents** 
- Keep running agents locally
- Register them with Agentverse for API access
- Use local addresses with cloud API

### **3. Configure Bridge**

Edit `agentverse_bridge.py`:
```python
AGENTVERSE_API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
HEALTH_AGENT_ADDRESS = "agent1qw..."  # From Agentverse dashboard
DOCTOR_AGENT_ADDRESS = "agent1q2..."  # From Agentverse dashboard  
PHARMACY_AGENT_ADDRESS = "agent1q0..." # From Agentverse dashboard
WELLNESS_AGENT_ADDRESS = "agent1qv..." # From Agentverse dashboard
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### **Test Bridge Health**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Agentverse Bridge", 
  "api_configured": true,
  "agents_configured": {
    "health": true,
    "doctor": true, 
    "pharmacy": true,
    "wellness": true
  }
}
```

### **Test Agent Status**  
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/agent-status
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "health": {
    "address": "agent1qw...",
    "status": "online",
    "last_checked": "2024-08-21 10:30:00"
  },
  "doctor": {
    "address": "agent1q2...", 
    "status": "online",
    "last_checked": "2024-08-21 10:30:00"
  }
}
```

### **Test Chat API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I walked 5000 steps today", "user_id": "test"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "response": "Agent response here...",
  "intent": "wellness", 
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "request_id": "uuid-here",
  "status": "success",
  "agent_used": "agent1qv..."
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **API Key Issues**
```
Error: "Invalid API key" 
```
**Solution:**
1. Check API key is correct in bridge code
2. Verify permissions on Agentverse dashboard
3. Ensure key hasn't expired

### **Agent Not Found**
```
Error: "Agent address not found"
```
**Solution:**
1. Check agent addresses in bridge configuration
2. Verify agents are deployed on Agentverse
3. Confirm agents are online in dashboard

### **No Agent Response**
```
Status: "message_sent" but no actual response
```
**This is expected behavior!** The current implementation:
1. ✅ Sends message to agent via Agentverse API
2. ✅ Confirms message delivery  
3. ⏱️ Agent processes asynchronously
4. 🔄 Response retrieval needs webhook setup (production feature)

For development, you'll see "Message sent to Agent" confirmations.

### **Bridge Won't Start**
```
Error: Module not found
```
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
```

---

## 🚀 Production Features

### **Webhook Integration** (Future)
Set up webhooks to receive agent responses in real-time:
```python
@app.post("/webhook/agent-response")  
async def handle_agent_response(response_data: dict):
    # Process real-time agent responses
    pass
```

### **Message Threading**
Match requests/responses by ID for proper conversation flow:
```python
# Include request_id in messages for correlation
payload["message"]["metadata"]["request_id"] = request_id
```

### **Agent Health Monitoring** 
Monitor agent uptime and performance:
```python
# Regular health checks via Agentverse API
async def monitor_agents():
    for agent in agents:
        status = await get_agent_health(agent.address)
```
